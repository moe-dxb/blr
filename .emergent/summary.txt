The AI engineer's work revolved around building a comprehensive internal employee portal for BLR World with a Google-first approach. Initial user requirements covered core HR functionalities, role-based access, and a focus on scalability and adaptability. A provided ZIP file contained an existing Next.js + Firebase project, shifting the development focus away from a previously planned FastAPI + React backend.

A significant portion of the trajectory involved resolving persistent deployment issues to Firebase via GitHub Actions. These included large file history rejections, Google Cloud service account permission errors (Secret Manager, Firebase Storage, Cloud Functions, Cloud Build), and Next.js build failures (missing module exports, type errors, memory limits). The engineer iteratively identified and fixed these, ensuring the CI/CD pipeline and application code were correctly configured for a dynamic Firebase Hosting deployment with Cloud Functions. The latest work focused on resolving Next.js build errors due to missing UI components and type mismatches. The portal now includes extensive features like Google-only sign-in, comprehensive roles, time tracking, leave management, HR policies, announcements, wellbeing events, community hub, and secure personal document handling, all managed through a robust Firebase backend and Next.js frontend.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently focused on resolving persistent build and deployment failures to Firebase Hosting and Cloud Functions via GitHub Actions, aiming for a fully dynamic and scalable deployment.

The immediate problem was a Next.js build failure caused by:
1.  **Missing UI Component Exports:**  and other pages attempted to import components (e.g., , , , , ) that were not properly exported from their respective  files.
2.  **Type Mismatch in Hook Call:** The  hook was called incorrectly with an object literal  instead of directly passing the  variable.

The AI engineer's recent actions to address these were:
-   **Updated UI Components:** Modified , , , and  to correctly export all required sub-components, types, and utility functions (e.g., , , , ).
-   **Fixed Firestore Hook Usage:** Corrected  to directly pass  to  and adjusted type casting for .
-   **Added Utility:** Introduced  with the  helper for Tailwind CSS.
-   **Refined TSConfig:** Ensured  has correct  aliases ( to ) and  rules to prevent  dependencies from interfering with the Next.js build's type checks.
-   **Deployment Pipeline Hardening:** The GitHub Actions workflow () has been continuously refined to handle:
    -   Setting  at the job level and explicitly enabling it.

   We detected TypeScript in your project and reconfigured your tsconfig.json file for you.
   The following suggested values were added to your tsconfig.json. These values can be changed to fit your project's needs:

   	- include was updated to add '.next/types/**/*.ts'
   	- plugins was updated to add { name: 'next' }).
    -   Non-interactive Firebase deploy commands.
    -   Graceful skipping of optional steps (like setting functions secrets) if permissions or secrets are not fully configured.

The state is that the code changes to resolve the Next.js build errors have been committed, and the engineer is awaiting the user to re-run the  GitHub Actions workflow to confirm a successful full deployment of the dynamic application.
