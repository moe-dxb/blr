## Folder Structure Fix ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Repository had nested structure `/app/blr/` causing GitHub Actions workflows to fail
**Solution**: Moved all project files from `/app/blr/` to `/app/` (repository root)
**Result**: 
- ✅ Proper folder structure established
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows should now work correctly
- ✅ Firebase deployment structure corrected

## Current Repository Structure
```
/app/ (Repository Root)
├── .github/workflows/          # GitHub Actions
│   ├── full-deployment.yml     # Main production deployment
│   ├── firebase-deploy.yml     # Standard Firebase deployment

## Testing Protocol
### Backend Testing
- Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for Firebase Functions testing
- Test authentication, leave management, attendance tracking

### Frontend Testing  
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI testing
- Test user interface, navigation, forms, data display
- **IMPORTANT**: Always ask user permission before frontend testing

### Testing Workflow
1. ✅ Read this file before any testing
2. 🔄 Test backend changes first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
3. ❓ ASK user permission before frontend testing
4. 🔄 Test frontend using `auto_frontend_testing_agent` (only if approved)
5. ✅ Update this file with results

## Incorporate User Feedback
- Always prioritize user's explicit requests
- Ask for clarification on ambiguous requirements
- Confirm major changes before implementation
- Focus on value-adding features over minor fixes

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Folder structure fixed - GitHub Actions should now work
2. 🔄 Continue Phase 3: Core HR Features development
3. 🔄 Implement Enhancement #3: Advanced Leave History with Manager Actions
4. 🧪 Test new features thoroughly
5. 📋 Prepare for Phase 4: Communication & Engagement features
